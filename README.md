# liri-node-app

Welcome to LIRI Bot!

LIRI Bot is here to help you find concerts, songs, and movie info.

Upon running the file you will be prompted to "concert-this", "spotify-this-song", "movie-this", or "do-what-it-says". With each selection you will be asked for a search parameter and then the app will return information about the subject that was entered.

To run the app you'll simply open the app in your terminal and then type out "node liri.js" and then press enter/return. Once the app is running you'll simply follow the directions that will pop up on the screen.

Here is a video demonstrating how the app works: https://youtu.be/AB5-_4mAvoQ
